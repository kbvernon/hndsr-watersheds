                <p class="map-description"> Explore humanity's evolving presence 
                in the US Southwest from 750 to 1600 CE. Hovering over a shape 
                will give you more details about that time and place. See

                <p>This map shows population estimates aggregated across 
                <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset">HUC10 watersheds</a>
                watersheds (a level of definition of watersheds used by the US 
                Geological Survey) and 25-year intervals. To arrive at those 
                estimates, we counted up the rooms in each residential site in 
                each watershed, under the assumption that more rooms means more 
                people. This is a common strategy in archaeology, and it is also 
                the strategy used by demographers today to estimate population 
                in areas where governments lack the resources to conduct a census 
                (for example, in the European Union's 
                <a href="https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">Global Human Settlement Layer</a>).</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, it is not reasonable to infer population size 
                directly from room counts. That would be like arguing that there 
                must be 100 people staying at a hotel because the hotel has 100 
                rooms. In reality, some number of rooms will typically be vacant 
                on a given day. The situation gets more complicated if we 
                imagine the hotel adding or removing rooms over time, which is 
                what happened at residential sites in the US Southwest during 
                the time period being modeled.</p>
                <p>To account for vacancy and changes in the sizes of 
                settlements over time, we simply assumed that each room 
                represents one person and that persons were evenly 
                (or uniformly) distributed over the years each site was occupied, 
                based on the associated pottery. For instance, if people lived 
                at a residential site for 100 years, that's four 25-year 
                intervals, and there are four rooms at that residence, then it 
                is assumed that one person lived at the site in each 25-year 
                interval. This was done for each residential site in the cyberSW 
                database, then those estimates were added up for each watershed 
                and time interval.</p>
                <p>There's a lot of variation in these estimates, with some 
                areas having huge populations, and others almost no human 
                presence at all. It's hard to visualize spatial and temporal 
                trends with information like this, so the map actually displays 
                the logarithm of occupied rooms (zero counts are listed as 
                log(1e-5)).</p>
