This small repo is for sharing an [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) + [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) app, built with much consternation üòñ and love ‚ù§Ô∏è using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It's a simple app, probably a smidge over-engineered for its purpose, but it did give me the opportunity to do a deep dive into the Observable dialect of JS, for whatever that's worth. Anyway, may it serve the PIs on this NSF HNDS-R well as they explore the watersheds of Arizona and New Mexico. üññ LL&P
