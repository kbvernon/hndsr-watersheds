description: "This map provides simple tools for exploring change in population density across HUC10 watersheds and 25-year intervals. Values are based on estimates of the number of occupied rooms per time interval. For visualization purposes, values are log-transformed (zero counts are calculated as log(1e-5)). By hovering your mouse over the watershed polygon, you can see the mean room count, area of each watershed, density, and log density."
